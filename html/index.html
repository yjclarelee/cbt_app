            <h1>What is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?</h1>
            <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people learn how to identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on behavior and emotions.<br/>
            Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing the automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen emotional difficulties, depression, and anxiety. These spontaneous negative thoughts have a detrimental influence on mood.<br/>
            Through CBT, these thoughts are identified, challenged, and replaced with more objective, realistic thoughts.</p>
